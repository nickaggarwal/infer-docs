title: "July 16th Update - Inferless AI Chatbot, CLI Improvements, and 30% faster build times"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

1. **Inferless AI Chatbot**: Our new chatbot is now available in the Inferless console to assist developers with their questions. You can ask queries on how to write integration files, explore different feature supports, and much more.

2. **Automatic TOML Detection**: The CLI now automatically detects TOML files for libraries and creates the runtime.yaml file, simplifying the setup process for your projects.

3. **Added OOM Detection**: We've implemented Out-Of-Memory (OOM) detection for models. If your model encounters an OOM error during inference, you will receive a notification suggesting you change the GPU type or switch from a shared to a dedicated environment.

4. **Build Speed Enhancements**: We've made significant changes to improve build times. By optimizing data handling, cluster-specific workers, and event-based model synchronization, build times are now 30% faster.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and enhancements.
