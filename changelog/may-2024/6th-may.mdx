title: "6th May 2024: Enhanced Serverless Speeds, Model Build Efficiency, and Runtime Improvements"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

1. **Container Concurrency for Serverless v2**: Once we migrate users to the latest version, it will allow you to deploy multiple instances of your application concurrently, enhancing scalability and responsiveness.

2. **Concurrent Build Workers**: To speed up the model import process, we've introduced concurrent build workers. This update minimizes wait times in the queue by allowing multiple builds to proceed simultaneously, significantly reducing overall build duration.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling for Builds**: We've improved error handling to better manage instances where builds may enter an infinite loop. This refinement helps in quickly identifying and resolving issues, ensuring smoother and more reliable build processes.

These updates underline our commitment to providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly platform. By continually enhancing our services and infrastructure, we aim to support your needs and empower your projects.
