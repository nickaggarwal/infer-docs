title: "June 10th Update - Streaming APIs and Flexible Logging Options"
---

**Latest Enhancements & Features:**

1. **Streaming APIs**: We now support streaming APIs with SSE, ideal for creating a communication channel from the server to the client. This is particularly useful for real-time chat, live updates, and streaming data such as audio and video frames. You can send multiple outputs for the same input, enhancing the versatility of your applications. Learn more in our documentation [here](https://docs.inferless.com/api-reference/streaming) 

2. **Flexible Logging Options with 'is_less':**: Weâ€™ve introduced is_less log options for users who need to trace logs only for specific requests. This feature helps in debugging applications more efficiently. Additionally, you have the option to switch to full logs to capture detailed CUDA-level errors when needed.
