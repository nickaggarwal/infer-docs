## For Docker File Integration

You can provide a dockerfile in a GitHub or Gitlab repository to host your model on the inferless platform. You need to run a webserver with the following APIs.

### Requirements for Docker Import

These are details that are needed while importing the model from GITHUB or GITLAB that has a dockerfile.

    * **Health check API**:- GET API - returns status 200 for a healthy state  
    * **Infer API** \- POST API - Returns s Dict  
    * **Server Port** \- The Port on which the model server is hosted  
    * **Dockerfile** \- The file for building the Docker
    * **Input - Sample** Json input for model inference  
    

```json
# Sample Input 
{
  "prompt":  "Once upon a time ", 
  "max_length": 50
}
```
